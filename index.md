Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# First Milestone
## Summary
My first milestone was achieved when I managed to control my arm manually and pick up a paper cylinder. I did this by first assembling the arm and utilizing the 3 servo pivots to maneuver my arm in various directions. 
## Components 
1. Servos - these are what move the arm, they are programmed to move from anywhere from 0-180 degrees.
2. Arduino Nano - this is what takes the code and inputs and tells certain pins on the Arduino to power, essentially it moves and controls the servos. The Arduino nano has pins on the bottom which vary from grounding, 5-volt power, reading and transmitting data, and data ports. The data ports are used to receive and send signals to the different things connected to it for example in my case how much to move the servo. Also, It can be used to receive, when it takes the input of the joystick.
3. Arduino Nano shield - this takes the pins of the Arduino and expands it to be more user-friendly. It also adds the necessary components to input more power into the system as the servos need more than the 5v that the Arduino provides. I used this to plug in my servos and also used this to add my 9v power supply.
## Challenges
One main challenge I faced was trying to add my Bluetooth module to control the arm using a phone app. When trying to connect the first issue I encountered was that I was unable to build my code onto the Arduino. The reason for this was I was plugging the bluetooth modules transmitting data cable into the default read data pin on the Arduino. This meant that the Arduino wasn't reading the code I was uploading but the bluetooth module was instead so the code didn't upload. 
## Next steps
My next step for this project is to create a wireless controller as right now the joysticks have to be plugged into the Arduino sheild which is very inconvenient. I also am going to strengthen the arm to hold at least two AA batteries along with putting it on wheels to add more maneuverability to the arm.

# Starter Project
## Summary
For my starter project I built a Simon says game. The game works by pushing the rubber pad onto the motherboard to complete the circuit allowing the microcontroller to understand that the button has been pressed. The goal is to click the colors in the order the game displays them using the LEDs. 
## Components 
1. ATmega328 - this is the brains of the game and holds the code which is preprogrammed in.
2. 10k resistor - this makes sure that the whole circuit isn't overloaded from the power being inputted. It takes the power and only lets some pass and lets the rest go as heat
3. Through-hole PCB - this connects all the components together in an organized manner.
4. Battery clips - this takes the battery charge and inputs it into the PCB. It acts as a bridge for the battery to the PCB
5. Slide switch - this turns on and off certain parts of the PCB, for example, the power and sound. I simply just break and connects different circuits
6. 0.1Î¼F Capacitor - this stores and releases energy 
## Challenges
The only challenge I faced was understanding which sides are positive and negative since they were not labeled, and to identify them I used a multimeter and used black and red pins to check continuity.
## Next Steps 
My next step is to start working on my intensive project which is the 3-jointed robotic arm

# Schematics 
<!---
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
